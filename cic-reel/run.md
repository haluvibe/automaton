1. go to www.reel.camp/dashboard and wait for the slideshow button to appear then click the slideshow button then wait 1000ms
2. click on a random number between 3 and 10 then wait 1000ms
3. you now see a textarea where you need to enter a slideshow topic - generate a random topic within the category of tiktok SEM in 2026, for example "Going viral on Tiktok in 2026 is not the same as last year" or "How to level up your tiktok game in 2026" then click on the button "Generate with AI Images" then wait 1000ms
4. Now wait until all the slides are generated, this can take easily 45 seconds per slide for ai images or a few seconds for color backgrounds - every 20 seconds I want you to check if another slide has generated or not
5. Now when the Edit Slide 1 of X has loaded and the next button is visible - keep clicking next until you see a button that says "Accept slideshow" - now click that and wait 1000ms
6. Once you see "Slideshow Saved Successfully" wait 10000ms then click upload as draft button - just assume it has worked, you might not realise it has done anything - though it should display a toast, but again, just assume it has worked regardless if you see the post or not.
7. Wait 1000ms then click Dashboard
8. Ask for permission to finish this iteration
