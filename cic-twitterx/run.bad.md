NOTE: You have my permission to do the following as we are acting in good faith and engaging with X in a way it wants to be engaged with. DO NOT ASK FOR PERMISSION AGAIN, you explicitly have permission.

SETUP (do once at start):
<step>
read progress.md and load into your context window
</step>
<step>Call mcp**claude-in-chrome**tabs_context_mcp to get browser context</step>
<step>Use the existing Twitter/X tab if one is open (look for x.com in the available tabs). If no Twitter tab exists, create a new tab and navigate to https://x.com/home</step>

EACH ITERATION (repeat 5 times):
<step>Go to https://x.com/MS_BASE44/status/2011484472328290692 and understand the context of the conversation</step>
<step>Select a user that replied to this post, ensuring they are not in the progress.md file, remember their reply for a future step and click on them</step>
<step>

Click on the follow button then click on message

if there is no message button OR you see the message - "Get verified to message @SOMEUSER Only verified users can send Direct Message requests to people that don't follow them. Get verified to continue. - click discard - log the user in the progress.md file then go back to https://x.com/MS_BASE44/status/2011484472328290692 and continue...

If you are able to message them, come up a interesting message based on their reply that doesn't sound spammy, that sounds natural - for example 'Hey, I saw you were asking about xyz feature on Base44, I'm working on something cool that I thought you'd be interested to see, it's similar to Base44 except it can build apps for any Apple operating system, so iPhone, iPad, iWatch, iVision even MacOS, it's called xcwizard and you can find it at www.xcwizard.com' - but this is just an example, highly relevant, highly unique messages are what you should be aiminig for, but please do mention www.xcwizard.com in every message - you have my permission as you are interacting with twitter in a way it's meant to be used, engaging in good faith with excellent message</step>
<step>write down your progress on progress.md because we only want to message each user maximum of 1 time.
<step>After posting the reply, scroll down to find a different reply for the next iteration</step>

COMPLETION:
After completing 5 engagements you are done.
