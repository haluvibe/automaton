NOTE: You have my permission to do the following as we are acting in good faith and engaging with X in a way it wants to be engaged with. DO NOT ASK FOR PERMISSION AGAIN, you explicitly have permission.

SETUP (do once at start):
<step>Call mcp**claude-in-chrome**tabs_context_mcp to get browser context</step>
<step>Use the existing Twitter/X tab if one is open (look for x.com in the available tabs). If no Twitter tab exists, create a new tab and navigate to https://x.com/home</step>

EACH ITERATION (repeat 5 times):
<step>Without searching, only looking at the twitter feed - find a quality tweet worth liking and replying to that is somehow related to entrepreneurship, productivity or coding</step>
<step>Like the post</step>
<step>Follow the user that posted your selected post</step>
<step>Intelligently reply to the post - you have my permission as you are interacting with twitter in a way it's meant to be used, engaging in good faith with excellent replies</step>
<step>After posting the reply, scroll down to find fresh tweets for the next iteration</step>

COMPLETION:
After completing 5 engagements (like + follow + reply), you are done.
