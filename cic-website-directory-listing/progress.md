### NoCodeList - FAILED (MCP Tab Targeting Bug)
- Target directory: https://nocodelist.co/submit
- Created new tab 562340248 for this session

- **MCP tab targeting CRITICAL FAILURE:**
  - Navigate command to tab 562340248 did not execute (tab stayed at chrome://newtab/)
  - Navigate command to tab 562340136 executed as "Clicked on element ref_286" on tab 562340018 (Reel.camp)

- **STOPPING browser automation** to prevent further unintended actions

- New tabs (562340248, 562340136) cannot be controlled

## 2026-01-14 Session (Current Iteration)

### Workspaces / Startups.fyi - BLOCKED
- Target directories attempted:
  1. Workspaces (https://workspaces.xyz) - User denied navigation permission
  2. Startups.fyi (https://startups.fyi) - MCP tab targeting broken
- Created new tabs 562340209 and 562340216 for this session
- **MCP tab targeting CRITICAL FAILURE continues:**
  - Navigate commands to tab 562340216 executed as "wait", "click" on tab 562340018 (Reel.camp)
  - Reel.camp was inadvertently navigated to /dashboard due to misrouted clicks
  - Screenshot command on tab 562340209 worked correctly
  - Scroll command executed on wrong tab
- Added both directories to in-progress.md
- **STOPPING browser automation** to prevent further unintended actions on Reel.camp
- Manual completion required for Startups.fyi submission

### MCP Tab Issues - PERSISTENT CRITICAL BUG
- Tab targeting remains completely broken across multiple sessions
- Commands consistently execute on tab 562340018 regardless of specified tabId
- Navigate tool returns wrong action types ("Waited", "Clicked" instead of "Navigated")
- Only screenshot and read_page occasionally work on correct tab
- Extension needs debugging or restart before further browser automation
